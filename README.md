# HDR UK Gateway - Frontend (Next.js)

Welcome to the HDR UK Gateway Frontend, a **Next.js** React application that powers the user interface of the **HDR UK Gateway**. This application facilitates seamless interaction with the [Gateway API](https://github.com/HDRUK/gateway-api-2) using:

- **[fetch](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch)** for efficient server-side communication.
- **[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)** for optimized client-side data fetching and state management.
- **[i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)** for internationalization and multi-language support.
- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)** for unit and snapshot testing.

This project utilizes the **App Router** of Next.js, providing improved performance and flexibility over the traditional Pages Router.

## 🧩 Internationalization (i18next)

This project uses **[i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)** for multilingual support, allowing for seamless language switching and localization. Translations are managed within the `/src/config/messages/` directory and integrated using the `i18next` library.


## 🧪 Testing with Jest

We use **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)** for unit testing and **React Testing Library** for component testing. Snapshot testing is included to ensure UI consistency.

To run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

To update snapshots:
```bash
npm test:snapshot
```
